      <p>My <i>favorite</i> thing about programming is when I change a text,
        and I actually know what it's doing.

      <h4>About Me</h4>
      <p>1914 translation by H. Rackham "On the other hand,
       we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are
       so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the
       moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain
       and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to
       those who fail in their duty through weakness of will,
       which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain.
       These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish.
       In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled
       and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best,
       every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided.
       But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty
       or the obligations of business it will frequently occur
       that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted.
       The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this
       principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other
       greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."</p>
       <h4>My Projects</h4>
       <ul>
        <l>Project 1</l>
        <l>Project 2</l>
        <l>Project 3</l>
       </ul>
    </div>
    <!-- 
      Directions:
        1. Create a DIV element to contain the page content
        2. Inside your DIV, create an H1 tag that contains your name as the text
        3. Below your H1 tag, create an H2 tag that contains the content text "Software Developer"
        4. Below your H2 tag, create an HR tag which will make a horizontal line
        5. Create a paragraph tag and put a sentence of your choice in it. (Suggestion: "My favorite thing about programming is _______")
        6. Make the word "favorite" italicized
        7. Make an image tag with the src attribute linked to a picture of yourself or of a placeholder image. Make sure you make an alt attribute too!
        8. Create an H3 tag that says "About Me"
        9. Create a paragraph tag that contains the "lorem ipsum" text. You will need to do a search for this text - it is long!
        10. Create an H3 tag that says "My Projects"
        11. Create an unordered list with 3 list items that say "Project 1", "Project 2", and "Project 3"
        12. Add another H3 that contains "Contact Me" as text
        13. Create a paragraph that contains a fake phone number, e.g., "Phone: (202) 555-1234"
        14. Create a link tag (<a>) with a direction to mail to a fake email address. This is done by making a regular link, but in the href attribute, put mailto:fake@email.com (this opens up your email program with the TO field already filled out-try it!)

        BONUS: Try one of the following ideas if you finish early
          - Switch out your lorem ipsum for Hipster Ipsum (https://hipsum.co/)
          - In your contact me section, make the text "Phone:" and "Email:" bolded
